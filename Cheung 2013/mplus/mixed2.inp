TITLE:	Mixed-effects model with equality constraints on the slopes
DATA:	FILE IS wvs94.dat;	
VARIABLE: NAMES Study y InterLS InterLC GNP;
	USEVARIABLES ARE y InterLS InterLC GNP;
	MISSING ARE *;
	! Centering is fine in this example as there is no missing data
       	DEFINE: CENTER GNP (GRANDMEAN);
	DEFINE: GNP=GNP/10000;
ANALYSIS: TYPE=RANDOM;
	ESTIMATOR=ML;		! Use ML method to calculate standard errors
MODEL:
	s_LS | y ON InterLS;
	s_LC | y ON InterLC;
	[y@0.0];			! Intercept of the effect size is fixed at 0.0
	y@1.0				! Error variance is fixed at 1.0

	s_LS*;				! t1,1 in the figure
	s_LC*;				! t2,1 in the figure
	s_LS WITH s_LC*;	! t2,2 in the figure
	[s_LS*];			! b11 in the figure
	[s_LC*];			! b21 in the figure
	s_LS ON GNP (1);	! Regression coefficients are the same
	s_LC ON GNP (1);

OUTPUT: SAMPSTAT;
	CINTERVAL(symmetric);
