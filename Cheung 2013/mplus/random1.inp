TITLE:	Random-effects model
DATA:	FILE IS wvs94.dat;	
VARIABLE: NAMES Study y InterLS InterLC GNP;
	USEVARIABLES ARE y InterLS InterLC;
	MISSING ARE *;

ANALYSIS: TYPE=RANDOM;
	ESTIMATOR=ML;		! Use ML method to calculate standard errors
MODEL:
	s_LS | y ON InterLS;
	s_LC | y ON InterLC;
	[y@0.0];			! Intercept of the effect size is fixed at 0.0
	y@1.0				! Error variance is fixed at 1.0

	s_LS*;				! t1,1 in the figure
	s_LC*;				! t2,1 in the figure
	s_LS WITH s_LC*;	! t2,2 in the figure
	[s_LS*];			! b1 in the figure
	[s_LC*];			! b2 in the figure
OUTPUT: SAMPSTAT;
